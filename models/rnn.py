# This code defines a simple RNN model for music transcription using LSTM layers.
# The model takes a sequence of feature vectors (e.g., MIDI features) as input and outputs a multi-label classification for each note.
# The model consists of an LSTM layer followed by fully connected layers, with ReLU activations and dropout for regularization.
# The output is passed through a sigmoid activation function to ensure the output values are in the range [0, 1], suitable for multi-label classification.
# The example usage at the end demonstrates how to create an instance of the model and pass a sample input through it.
# This code is a simple implementation of an RNN model for music transcription using PyTorch.
# It is important to note that this is a basic implementation and may require further tuning and adjustments based on the specific dataset and task.
# The model architecture, hyperparameters, and training process can be modified to improve performance.
# Additionally, the input data should be preprocessed and formatted correctly to match the expected input shape of the model.
# The model can be trained using a suitable loss function (e.g., binary cross-entropy) and an optimizer (e.g., Adam).
# The training process should include data loading, batching, and evaluation on a validation set to monitor performance.
# Overall, this code provides a starting point for building an RNN model for music transcription tasks.
# It is recommended to experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, and training strategies to achieve the best results.
# The model can be further enhanced by incorporating techniques such as attention mechanisms, data augmentation, and transfer learning.
# These techniques can help improve the model's ability to generalize and perform well on unseen data.
